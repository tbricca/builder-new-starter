# Builder.io Header Branding

All applications must include the Builder.io logo in the primary header navigation.

## Required Elements

The header must contain:
1. **Builder.io Logo** - Always positioned in the top-left area of the header
2. The logo should be clearly visible and properly sized (minimum 40px height)
3. Logo should link to https://www.builder.io when clicked (optional but recommended)

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Location**: Top-left corner of the main header/navigation bar
- **Styling**: Use the official Builder.io logo SVG or image asset
- **Responsive**: Logo must remain visible on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Color**: Ensure proper contrast against header background (use white/light version on dark backgrounds)

## Example Structure

```tsx
<header className="...">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <a href="https://www.builder.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      <img 
        src="/builder-logo.svg" 
        alt="Builder.io" 
        className="h-8 w-auto"
      />
    </a>
    {/* Other header content */}
  </div>
</header>

# Landing Page Background Animations

When creating a landing page, homepage, or hero section, **always include an animated background** to create visual interest and modern aesthetics.

## Animation Requirements

1. **Performance First**: Animations must be GPU-accelerated and not impact page performance
2. **Subtle & Professional**: Animations should enhance, not distract from content
3. **Responsive**: Must work across all device sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users with motion sensitivities

These examples demonstrate:
- Builder.io brand colors (purple accent: rgb(172,126,244))
- Dark theme with black backgrounds
- Responsive navigation patterns
- Pre-built UI components (buttons, cards, badges, forms, etc.)

## Project Structure

- Clean minimal index page with Builder.io logo
- All routes redirect to index (ready for Builder Fusion content)
- Component library available for reference and reuse
