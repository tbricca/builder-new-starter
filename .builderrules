# Builder Fusion Starter Template

This is a clean starter template for Builder Fusion (app builder) projects.

## Loading Page

While the app is being built, show a loading page with the message:

**"Building something awesome"**

Use the default font stack (system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif) for consistent typography across all platforms.

## Design System Reference

Example design systems and UI components can be found in the `example-code/` directory:
- `example-code/pages/` - Reference page implementations (About, Dashboard, Components, NotFound)
- `client/components/ui/` - Full Radix UI component library with Tailwind CSS styling

These examples demonstrate:
- Builder.io brand colors (purple accent: rgb(172,126,244))
- Dark theme with black backgrounds
- Responsive navigation patterns
- Pre-built UI components (buttons, cards, badges, forms, etc.)

## Project Structure

- Clean minimal index page with Builder.io logo
- All routes redirect to index (ready for Builder Fusion content)
- Component library available for reference and reuse
